THE OBSERVATORY
Out class when on a field trip to a YASH observatory. It
was located on top of a RAJU5, and it looked like a giant
RAJU6 with a slit down its RAJU2. We went inside and
looked through a RAJU4 and were able to see RAJU8s in
the sky that were millions of RAJU11s away. The men and
women who RAM1 in the observatory are called
RAJU1s, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting RAJU10s. An eclipse occurs when a RAJU3
comes between the earth and the RAJU7 and everything
gets YASH1. Next week, we place to RAM the
Museum of Modern RAJU9.
