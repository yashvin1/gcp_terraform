THE OBSERVATORY
Out class when on a field trip to a YASH observatory. It
was located on top of a RAJU7, and it looked like a giant
RAJU2 with a slit down its RAJU8. We went inside and
looked through a RAJU5 and were able to see RAJU11s in
the sky that were millions of RAJU6s away. The men and
women who RAM in the observatory are called
RAJU3s, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting RAJU1s. An eclipse occurs when a RAJU10
comes between the earth and the RAJU4 and everything
gets YASH2. Next week, we place to RAM1 the
Museum of Modern RAJU9.
