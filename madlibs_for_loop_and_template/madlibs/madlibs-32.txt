THE OBSERVATORY
Out class when on a field trip to a YASH observatory. It
was located on top of a RAJU11, and it looked like a giant
RAJU5 with a slit down its RAJU4. We went inside and
looked through a RAJU2 and were able to see RAJU3s in
the sky that were millions of RAJU8s away. The men and
women who RAM in the observatory are called
RAJU10s, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting RAJU7s. An eclipse occurs when a RAJU6
comes between the earth and the RAJU1 and everything
gets YASH1. Next week, we place to RAM1 the
Museum of Modern RAJU9.
