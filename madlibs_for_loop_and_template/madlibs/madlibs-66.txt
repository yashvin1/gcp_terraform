THE OBSERVATORY
Out class when on a field trip to a YASH observatory. It
was located on top of a RAJU7, and it looked like a giant
RAJU11 with a slit down its RAJU8. We went inside and
looked through a RAJU4 and were able to see RAJU6s in
the sky that were millions of RAJU10s away. The men and
women who RAM in the observatory are called
RAJU9s, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting RAJU3s. An eclipse occurs when a RAJU2
comes between the earth and the RAJU5 and everything
gets YASH1. Next week, we place to RAM1 the
Museum of Modern RAJU1.
