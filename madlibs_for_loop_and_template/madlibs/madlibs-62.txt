THE OBSERVATORY
Out class when on a field trip to a YASH2 observatory. It
was located on top of a RAJU6, and it looked like a giant
RAJU9 with a slit down its RAJU4. We went inside and
looked through a RAJU2 and were able to see RAJU3s in
the sky that were millions of RAJU5s away. The men and
women who RAM1 in the observatory are called
RAJU8s, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting RAJU11s. An eclipse occurs when a RAJU7
comes between the earth and the RAJU10 and everything
gets YASH1. Next week, we place to RAM the
Museum of Modern RAJU1.
