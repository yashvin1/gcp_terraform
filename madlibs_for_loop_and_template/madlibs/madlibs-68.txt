THE OBSERVATORY
Out class when on a field trip to a YASH2 observatory. It
was located on top of a RAJU6, and it looked like a giant
RAJU8 with a slit down its RAJU11. We went inside and
looked through a RAJU7 and were able to see RAJU10s in
the sky that were millions of RAJU2s away. The men and
women who RAM1 in the observatory are called
RAJU5s, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting RAJU9s. An eclipse occurs when a RAJU4
comes between the earth and the RAJU1 and everything
gets YASH. Next week, we place to RAM the
Museum of Modern RAJU3.
