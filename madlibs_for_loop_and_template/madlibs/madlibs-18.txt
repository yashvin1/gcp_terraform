THE OBSERVATORY
Out class when on a field trip to a YASH observatory. It
was located on top of a RAJU11, and it looked like a giant
RAJU7 with a slit down its RAJU3. We went inside and
looked through a RAJU5 and were able to see RAJU8s in
the sky that were millions of RAJU6s away. The men and
women who RAM in the observatory are called
RAJU10s, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting RAJU9s. An eclipse occurs when a RAJU2
comes between the earth and the RAJU1 and everything
gets YASH2. Next week, we place to RAM1 the
Museum of Modern RAJU4.
