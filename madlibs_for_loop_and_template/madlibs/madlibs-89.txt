HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER
Many YASH2 photographers make big money
photographing RAJU4s and beautiful RAJU3s. They sell
the prints to YASH1 magazines or to agencies who use
them in RAJU11 advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a RAJU1 camera. You also need an
YASH meter and filters and a special close-up
RAJU6. Then you either hire professional RAJU3s or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary RAJU9s. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very SHARMA for at
least 100000 years.
