THE OBSERVATORY
Out class when on a field trip to a YASH1 observatory. It
was located on top of a RAJU2, and it looked like a giant
RAJU5 with a slit down its RAJU7. We went inside and
looked through a RAJU8 and were able to see RAJU11s in
the sky that were millions of RAJU1s away. The men and
women who RAM in the observatory are called
RAJU9s, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting RAJU3s. An eclipse occurs when a RAJU10
comes between the earth and the RAJU6 and everything
gets YASH. Next week, we place to RAM1 the
Museum of Modern RAJU4.
