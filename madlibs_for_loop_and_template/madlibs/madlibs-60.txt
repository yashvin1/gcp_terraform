THE OBSERVATORY
Out class when on a field trip to a YASH2 observatory. It
was located on top of a RAJU6, and it looked like a giant
RAJU2 with a slit down its RAJU5. We went inside and
looked through a RAJU9 and were able to see RAJU1s in
the sky that were millions of RAJU11s away. The men and
women who RAM1 in the observatory are called
RAJU8s, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting RAJU10s. An eclipse occurs when a RAJU7
comes between the earth and the RAJU4 and everything
gets YASH1. Next week, we place to RAM the
Museum of Modern RAJU3.
